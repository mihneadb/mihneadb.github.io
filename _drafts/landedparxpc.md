* parxpc (bug number link) landed in m-c this night
* for who doesn't know, xpcshel... [what it is]
* what does this mean? basically, speedup == nr of cores (assuming SSD)
* why? IO
* so how do I get it? update m-c, that's it - now mach xpc-test does #work
* for safety, --sequential
* this is not turned on in automation because flaky tests
* should be all fine locally
* if you want to help, there's also the --shuffle option
* will get back with a blog post about the whole process
