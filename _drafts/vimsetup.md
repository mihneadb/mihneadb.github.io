* vim.. short intro
* why I use it -
 * it's everywhere
 * it's FAST
 * I have a setup that mostly does all I need
 * macros
 * did I mention it's everywhere?

The default options:
 * start with nothing and hate it
 * start with a "distro" (like janus)

Problems with those:
 * you have nothing, you'll hate it
 * you'll have lots of stuff that you won't know how to configure or where it
   came from

* started out with carluda/janus, which I recommend if you don't care and
want just a mostly working editor with less of the vim magic

I suggest starting out with your own setup. It will take a bit, but think of it
as an investment. You will know what features you need, where you got them from
and how to configure them. Even more, you won't have random stuff installed that
you don't care about.

* vundle, describe a bit compared to pathogen ;; package manager for vim

* suggestions:
 - start small
 - you will want to have all the functionality your existing editor has
 - add a few extras like fast cmd P and cmd R

* what I use
