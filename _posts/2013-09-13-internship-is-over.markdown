Today was the last day of my summer internship at Mozilla. It's been three
months of both fun and hard work. I got to meet and work with great people,
and made some friends along the way. San Francisco is nice and, on top of all,
Mozilla is awesome!

This was my second time on the *Automation and Tools* team, so I already had
a pretty good idea of what was going on, which allowed me to have useful
contributions right away. The thing I loved most was that I got to work on whatever
I found interesting, and even side projects that looked useful became full
time assignments.

I know that at some companies interns don't get to work on important projects.
I want to point out that Mozilla is not one of those companies. For example,
my main project led to saving years of compute time every month on our test
slaves, which basically means (aside from the financial aspect) that now
developers can find out if their patches are good to land faster than before,
so Firefox and the other Mozilla products can become better, faster. You can
read about it
[here](http://www.mihneadb.net/post/parallelizing-a-test-harness/). I also
talked about it in
[my intern presentation](https://air.mozilla.org/intern-presentation-Dobrescu-Balaur/).
The slides are
[here](http://l.bitcasa.com/FQyyRdWZ).

I won't talk about the
perks, everybody knows what they are and all companies have them.
That's not the point.
The cool thing about Mozilla is the
community of people that work there and the fact that they are all mission driven
and at the top of their field. So if you are interested in doing a tech internship
and you share Mozilla's
[values](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/),
I highly recommend you give Mozilla a try. Let me know if you have any questions!
