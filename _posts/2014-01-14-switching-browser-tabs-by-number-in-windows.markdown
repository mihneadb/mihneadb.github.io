I always loved the Linux/OS X shortcut that allows you to go to any tab between
1 and 8 by using `ALT + number` (or `CMD + number`). However, I couldn't get
it to work on Windows. Recently, out of pure luck, I stubmled across the
working key combination - you just have to use `CTRL` instead!

So, next time you're browsing the Web on a Windows box, go ahead and switch
between tabs using `CTRL + number`!


P.S.: `9` refers to the last tab. And if you really use tabs and find yourself
having lots of them open all the time, I suggest you try out
[Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)
for Firefox.
