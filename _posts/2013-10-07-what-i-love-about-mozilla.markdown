I've been pretty involved with Mozilla recently and, between my
last internship and the MozSummit this weekend, some thoughts started to
crystallize on what it is that I like the most about it. Keep in mind,
these words only shape my impression.

When I mention Mozilla to people, they usually think "ah, Firefox!". While
[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com)
is our most popular project right now, there is so much more to Mozilla than just that,
which is why I'm writing this.

It all starts with our [mission](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/),
which, as
[Mitchell](https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/) explained at the Summit,
can be reduced to three basic principles:

1. The Web should be *open*: The Internet is a public source of information
that must be open to and accessible to anybody
around the world.

2. The Web should be *interoperable*: People should not be locked in to an ecosystem and they should be able to
use the technology they prefer to access the Internet.

3. The Web should be *ours*: People should have the ability to shape the Internet experience and
be able to contribute with content without requiring permission from a central
entity.

There's nothing here about JavaScript performance, app startup time, scrolling
smoothness
or other buzz words and, while these things are definitely not ignored, it shows
that Mozilla has different priorities.

Every time I see a demo or read about a new project that is being worked on,
I'm impressed to see how people are pursuing standardization and keeping user
choice into perspective at all times. This again shows that we are not in some
sort of feature race, trying to distinguish ourselves through features that others
don't have. If you've been paying attention to the principles, you'll know that
this is actually unthinkable - *the Web should be interoperable*, remember?

The mission is what drives the [community](https://mozillians.org). I think we
have the greatest community out there - developers, designers, testers, reps
and others,
all working together to make sure that (again, paraphrasing Mitchell) the Internet
is *what the world needs it to be*. Unlike other projects, where the surrounding
community has a small supporting role, Mozilla as we know it would not be possible
without its army of volunteers.

Besides Firefox, we are working on other projects that make the Web more
accessible and drive it forward. Firefox OS and Webmaker come to mind.
[Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) helps bring the Internet closer
to people who don't currently have a smartphone. At the same time it helps push
Web technologies forward by providing the same support that developers currently
have on closed, proprietary platforms through native apps.
[Webmaker](https://webmaker.org/) is about shaping *our* Internet - it enables
people to contribute with their own content to the Web.

Having the mission, the awesome volunteers and the community-facing projects,
Mozilla is different. It is special. It's something that many did not think
was possible. Not long ago, it was assumed that free, open software would
never reach a relevant market share. Firefox did that and it was the driving
factor in making it so that today we have other options than just Internet
Explorer in browsing the Web. Our community shows that a group of people that is spread
all over across the world can still do great work together. Firefox OS is pushing the
Web forward, closer to the increasingly popular mobile devices. All these and
more developed in the open by passionate people. What's not to love?!
