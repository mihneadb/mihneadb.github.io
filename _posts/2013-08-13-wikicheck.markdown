I was checking out Wikipedia's API and I thought "why not make a
small app that uses it?".

The result is [wikicheck](http://www.mihneadb.net/wiki-check). You can find
the source on [github](http://github.com/mihneadb/wiki-check).

It's nothing fancy, but I feel it's useful for when you want to do some
quick researh on Wikipedia without using your mouse. And it is a demo for
Wikipedia's API, in case the docs are unclear (they sure were to me!).
